# YouTube Analysis Project

Are you tired of that boring 9-5 job? Do you feel like you can never get ahead? When is the last time you took a vacation? What if you could solve all of these problems by doing one simple thing? It turns out - YOU CAN! Just become YouTube Famous!

In this project we used a YouTube video dataset found on kaggle to determine what factors are most important for predicting the popularity of a channel on YouTube. Questions we have going into this project included:

- What video titles attracted the most attention? 
- Are the factors that predict the most likes on a video different from the factors that predict the most subscribers to a channel?
- Are certain genres of videos more popular during certain seasons? 
- What types of videos get the most comments and how do comments influence channel or video popularity? 
- Can we categorize videos based on their comments?
- How does video popularity vary by country?

In order to answer these questions we will be using Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze our data and display visual representations of our findings.
